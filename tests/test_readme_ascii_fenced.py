"""Regression guard for the README title presentation.

Originally (#1390) the README opened with an ASCII-art banner that had to live
inside a ``` code fence, otherwise GitHub's markdown collapsed its leading
whitespace and box-drawing rules and rendered it misaligned. The README refresh
(#4306) dropped that banner in favour of a centered wordmark image. The Pandamonium
fork now opens with its own heading plus explicit Pandamonium attribution, while
still catching the original failure mode if an un-fenced ASCII banner returns.
