# Release and container process

## Source compatibility

`voice-orb-v0.3.0-beta.1` remains ported from upstream commit `c80462e4621c1a3360e5441843bb83b4691a8766`. The machine-readable record is `compatibility.json`. The public beta branch is constructed from that upstream commit; private development history is not published wholesale.

| Release | Tag | Upstream base | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| v0.1.0-alpha.1 | `voice-orb-v0.1.0-alpha.1` | `c80462e4621c1a3360e5441843bb83b4691a8766` | Voice, foreground control, Calendar, and read-only workers; container blocked by Trivy |
| v0.1.0-alpha.2 | `voice-orb-v0.1.0-alpha.2` | `c80462e4621c1a3360e5441843bb83b4691a8766` | Same camera-free scope with the bundled Docker CLI removed from the hardened image |
| v0.2.0-alpha.1 | `voice-orb-v0.2.0-alpha.1` | `c80462e4621c1a3360e5441843bb83b4691a8766` | Adds bounded camera frames and allowlisted local media |
| v0.3.0-beta.1 | `voice-orb-v0.3.0-beta.1` | `c80462e4621c1a3360e5441843bb83b4691a8766` | Adds guided setup status/text parity, honest fixed-worker readiness, and explicit admin-only Tailnet list-then-selected-probe |

v0.3 adds no database migration. Provider credentials remain in Settings and
worker credentials remain in mounted token files; setup guidance never speaks
credential values or paths. This remains a maintained fork, not a plugin.

## CI gates

| Gate | Workflow |
|---|---|
| `compileall`, `node --check`, full pytest, diff check, Compose config | `.github/workflows/ci.yml` and Voice Orb release preflight |
| Fake microphone/camera browser lifecycle | Voice Orb release preflight using `@playwright/test` |
| Pull-request dependency review and advisory audits | `.github/workflows/dependency-review.yml` |
| Dockerfile lint and image build | `.github/workflows/container-scan.yml` and release workflow |
| Trivy image scan | `.github/workflows/container-trivy.yml` and release workflow |
| Full-history upstream scan plus blocking public-delta secret scan | `.github/workflows/secret-scan.yml` and release workflow |
| Workflow lint/security | `.github/workflows/workflow-security.yml` |

The public scrub is also required before tagging. It must fail on private notes, handovers, personal/business data, real private hostnames or addresses, private paths, credentials, cloned voices, or assets without redistribution rights. For the Voice Orb media delta it also verifies canonical paths, MIME, provenance, license, checksum, silent media, and rejects undeclared media, audio bundles, and private frame artifacts without scanning inherited upstream assets.

## Publish

Create the annotated source tag only from a fully verified beta commit:

```bash
git tag -a voice-orb-v0.3.0-beta.1 -m 'Pandamonium Voice Orb v0.3.0-beta.1'
git push origin voice-orb-v0.3.0-beta.1
```

The tag-triggered release workflow verifies the compatibility record, runs the release gates, builds natively for `linux/amd64` and `linux/arm64`, pushes by digest, and creates one manifest tagged `voice-orb-v0.3.0-beta.1` in GHCR.

Record the resulting manifest digest in the GitHub release notes. Users should deploy `ghcr.io/madpanda3d/pandamonium@sha256:DIGEST`; the tag is a discovery label, while the digest is the immutable pin.

## Nightly drift check

The non-release upstream compatibility workflow reapplies the public beta delta to current upstream `dev`, then runs bounded syntax and focused tests. It never publishes an image. A failure is a drift signal, not permission to merge upstream changes automatically.
