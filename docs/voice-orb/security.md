# Security model

Voice Orb adds microphone, camera, local-media, and optional worker trust boundaries to an already powerful self-hosted application. Authentication stays enabled by default, and the beta intentionally keeps its public capability set narrow.

## Browser control boundary

The model can emit only enumerated `ui_control` events for Calendar open, document close/minimize, and view-state reporting. Client state contains logical view names, open/minimized flags, Calendar view/date, and active document ID. Selectors, scripts, arbitrary URLs, HTML, and generic DOM commands are rejected.

Voice requests are same-origin, owner-scoped, and authenticated. Unknown request fields are rejected. API bearer tokens are not accepted for voice orchestration.

## Camera and frame boundary

Only four exact, single-purpose phrases control camera behavior. The first slice rejects compound open-and-describe behavior. Camera access is allowed for the top-level same-origin application and explicitly denied to rendering/iframe layers. The browser owns permission, capture, and the native video element; models never receive selectors, media-device handles, or a continuous stream.

One optional frame may accompany a describe request. The server accepts only JPEG or PNG, valid base64 and matching magic bytes, dimensions no greater than 1024 by 576, and approximately 1 MiB decoded. It analyzes bytes in memory and never writes the raw frame to uploads, caches, session state, diagnostics, or logs.

## Local-media boundary

Playback accepts an allowlisted manifest ID, never a caller URL or filesystem path. The manifest permits canonical same-origin Voice Orb paths and known video MIME types only. Release scrub verifies every bundled file's ID, MIME, license, provenance fields, SHA-256 checksum, silent tag, WebM signature, and absence of an audio track marker. Undeclared Voice Orb media, audio bundles, and frame artifacts fail the release gate.

## Worker boundary

Workers are disabled until explicitly configured. The public beta accepts `read_only` tasks only, rejects caller-provided approval elevation, uses fixed adapter IDs, and verifies ownership in broker helpers so internal callers cannot bypass route checks. Worker tokens come from files, not public status or request bodies.

Run worker services with least privilege, a dedicated OS account, a read-only execution profile, and a neutral workspace allowlist. Do not mount the Docker socket or writable host directories merely to make a worker pass a health check.

## Network boundary

Keep Pandamonium on loopback or behind an authenticated HTTPS reverse proxy/private access gateway. Keep model and worker ports private. Restrict `ALLOWED_ORIGINS`, set `SECURE_COOKIES=true` behind HTTPS, and never enable the development localhost bypass on a shared deployment.

Default model discovery never reads Tailscale state. Tailnet discovery is an
admin-only, explicit two-step operation: `tailnet_peers` returns short-lived
opaque IDs without probing, then `tailnet_probe` accepts no more than five IDs
from that listing and checks only fixed model-list targets. Results omit peer
hostnames, addresses, Tailnet names, URLs, and raw errors.

This path performs no agent discovery, blind or unselected Tailnet scan,
`tailscale up`, ACL or Funnel change, device enrollment, or wildcard-interface
binding. Unknown discovery modes fail closed.

## Release controls

Release tags run syntax checks, full pytest, Compose validation, fake-device browser checks, dependency audit, secret scanning, Docker build, and Trivy before a multi-architecture image is published. GitHub Actions are pinned to commit SHAs. The public scrub rejects private notes, topology, data, secrets, and unlicensed assets.

Report vulnerabilities through `SECURITY.md`; do not post credentials, private logs, private addresses, or proof-of-concept data in a public issue.
