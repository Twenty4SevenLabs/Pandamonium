# Pandamonium Setup Guide

This page keeps the detailed install, deployment, troubleshooting, and configuration notes out of the front README.

## Quick Start

The supported release line is `main`. Pandamonium retains its upstream history
and attribution; the original Odysseus project remains available at
[pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus](https://github.com/pewdiepie-archdaemon/odysseus).

Defaults work out of the box: clone, run, then configure models/search/email
inside **Settings**. Only edit `.env` for deployment-level overrides like
`APP_BIND`, `APP_PORT`, `AUTH_ENABLED`, `DATABASE_URL`, or a pre-seeded admin password.

On first setup, Pandamonium creates an admin account (`admin` unless
`PANDAMONIUM_ADMIN_USER` is set) and prints a temporary password in the terminal.
For Docker installs, the same line is in `docker compose logs pandamonium`.
Use that for the first login, then change it in **Settings**.

New deployment settings use the `PANDAMONIUM_*` prefix. Existing
`ODYSSEUS_*` settings remain accepted as migration aliases, with a canonical
Pandamonium value taking precedence when both are set.

### Docker (recommended)
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium.git
cd Pandamonium
cp .env.example .env       # optional, but recommended for explicit defaults
docker compose up -d --build
```
To include optional extras in the image (PDF viewer, Office extraction; includes AGPL PyMuPDF), build with `docker compose build --build-arg INSTALL_OPTIONAL=true` before `up`.

Open `http://localhost:7000` when the containers are healthy. Docker Compose
binds the web UI to `127.0.0.1` by default. If the port is taken, set
`APP_PORT=7001` in `.env` and recreate the container. Set `APP_BIND=0.0.0.0`
only when you intentionally want LAN/reverse-proxy access.

> **On Apple Silicon (M-series) Macs:** Docker can't reach the Metal GPU, so
> Cookbook serves local models on CPU only. For GPU-accelerated model serving,
> run natively instead — see [Apple Silicon](#apple-silicon) below.

### Native Linux / macOS
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium.git
cd Pandamonium
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7000
```
Requirements: Python 3.11+. Scanned-PDF OCR requires `tesseract` and `pdftoppm`
(`tesseract-ocr`, `tesseract-ocr-eng`, and `poppler-utils` on Debian/Ubuntu;
`brew install tesseract poppler` on macOS). They are already bundled in the
Docker image. Cookbook also needs `tmux` for background model
downloads and serves. The app itself is lightweight; local model serving is the
heavy part and depends on the model, runtime, GPU, and VRAM, so small hosts can
connect to API or remote model servers instead. Use `--host 0.0.0.0` only when you intentionally want LAN/reverse-proxy access.

### Atomic native Linux updates

The fixed footer can install a signed Pandamonium release only when Linux is
using the managed immutable layout below. A normal Git checkout is never
rewritten in place, and a Docker container must be updated from its host.

```text
/opt/pandamonium/
  current -> releases/1.0.11-<commit8>
  releases/<version>-<commit8>/
  venvs/<version>-<commit8>/
/var/lib/pandamonium/data/
/var/backups/pandamonium/
```

Every release artifact has a SHA-256 digest, exact Git commit, requirements
digest, compatibility/migration contract, and Ed25519 signature. The embedded
public key verifies that manifest before any archive is extracted. An update
then performs these steps in order:

1. download and verify the signed manifest and checksummed artifact;
2. stage a new immutable release and reuse or build its virtual environment;
3. create and verify a full data backup, including uploads and documents;
4. restore that backup into a rehearsal directory and run migrations twice;
5. stop the app, run the same idempotent migrations twice on live data, and
   atomically switch the `current` symlink;
6. start the app and verify both `/api/health` and the exact target version;
7. automatically restore the prior symlink and backup if any live step fails.

The authenticated admin UI writes only a request under the external data
directory. Install the root-owned units so systemd performs the privileged
work. Review and adjust every path before enabling them:

```bash
sudo install -m 0644 pandamonium-updater.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo install -m 0644 pandamonium-updater.path /etc/systemd/system/
sudo install -m 0644 pandamonium-update-recover.service /etc/systemd/system/
sudo install -d -m 0755 /etc/pandamonium
sudoedit /etc/pandamonium/update.env
sudo systemctl daemon-reload
sudo systemctl enable --now pandamonium-updater.path
sudo systemctl enable pandamonium-update-recover.service
```

`/etc/pandamonium/update.env` must be readable only by root and define the same
data path and app port used by the web service:

```ini
PANDAMONIUM_DATA_DIR=/var/lib/pandamonium/data
PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_ROOT=/opt/pandamonium
PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_TRIGGER=systemd-path
PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_SERVICE=pandamonium.service
PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_BACKUP_DIR=/var/backups/pandamonium
PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_CONFIG_FILES=/etc/pandamonium/update.env
PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_CHANNEL=stable
APP_PORT=7000
```

Copy those non-secret values into the app service environment too, then add an
app-service ordering drop-in so boot recovery completes first:

```ini
[Unit]
After=pandamonium-update-recover.service
```

Do not add `Wants=pandamonium-update-recover.service` to the app service. The
enabled recovery unit is ordered before the app at boot; pulling it into every
manual app start can make an updater-initiated restart wait on its own recovery
transaction.

Use `./scripts/pandamonium update check` and `update status` for readback. The
footer's **Check for updates** action never installs by itself; **Update now**
requires a separate confirmation and shows phase, percentage, backup path,
result, and rollback availability. Set `PANDAMONIUM_UPDATE_CHANNEL=prerelease`
only on hosts that intentionally accept prereleases.

The updater keeps the immediately previous immutable release and exact verified
backup. A manual rollback restores both when the signed compatibility contract
requires data restoration. Interrupted live activation is recovered from the
persisted state by `pandamonium-update-recover.service` at boot.

### Apple Silicon
Docker on macOS cannot use the Metal GPU. For GPU-accelerated Cookbook on an
M-series Mac, run Pandamonium natively:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium.git
cd Pandamonium
./start-macos.sh
```

It launches at `http://127.0.0.1:7860`. To expose it to your phone over a trusted LAN/VPN such as Tailscale, bind all interfaces:

```bash
PANDAMONIUM_HOST=0.0.0.0 ./start-macos.sh
# then open http://<tailscale-ip>:7860
```

The script also reads `.env` at startup, so `APP_BIND=0.0.0.0` and `APP_PORT`
set there are picked up automatically without a command-line override each run.

Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true` (the default) before binding outside loopback. Do not
expose this port directly to the public internet. To build a clickable app wrapper:

```bash
./build-macos-app.sh
```

<details>
<summary>Cookbook, GPU, Ollama, and troubleshooting notes</summary>

**Docker bundled services.** Compose starts Pandamonium, ChromaDB, SearXNG, and
ntfy. Pandamonium and the bundled service ports bind to `127.0.0.1` by default, so
they are reachable from the host but not exposed to your LAN/public internet
unless you opt in.

**Cookbook storage in Docker.** Downloads live in `./data/huggingface`
(`~/.cache/huggingface` in the container). Cookbook-installed Python CLIs and
serve engines live in `./data/local` (`~/.local` in the container), so they
survive container recreation.

**Remote servers.** In **Cookbook -> Settings -> Servers**, generate the
Pandamonium SSH key and add the public key to the remote server's
`~/.ssh/authorized_keys`. From the host you can also run:

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i data/ssh/id_ed25519.pub user@server
```

**Host Docker access (explicit opt-in).** Default Docker Compose intentionally
does not mount `/var/run/docker.sock`. You can still connect Pandamonium to
existing Ollama, vLLM, and other OpenAI-compatible endpoints without Docker
socket access.

You can still connect Pandamonium to existing Ollama, vLLM, and other
OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Remote server workflows over SSH remain the
preferred management path. If host-daemon control is unavoidable, use a
separate custom image with an independently audited Docker client and accept
that raw socket access effectively grants broad control over the host; that
configuration is outside the supported public alpha.

**Docker GPU overlays.** CPU-only users can skip this section. Cookbook can
only detect GPUs that Docker exposes to the container — if the host runtime or
device passthrough is not configured, Cookbook sees the iGPU, another card, or
CPU instead of your intended GPU.

For NVIDIA, `scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh` diagnoses GPU passthrough and can
optionally install the host runtime or update `.env`.

```bash
# Read-only diagnostic (default — installs nothing, never edits .env):
scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh

# Print OS-specific install commands without running them:
scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh --print-install-commands

# Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit on Ubuntu/Debian (requires sudo):
scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh --install-nvidia-toolkit

# Write COMPOSE_FILE to .env (only when GPU passthrough is confirmed working):
scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh --enable-nvidia-overlay

# Full assisted setup — install toolkit, then enable overlay if passthrough works:
scripts/check-docker-gpu.sh --install-nvidia-toolkit --enable-nvidia-overlay
```

Safety notes:
- The app never installs host GPU runtime automatically.
- The app never edits `.env` automatically.
- `.env` is only modified when `--enable-nvidia-overlay` is explicitly passed,
  and only after GPU passthrough succeeds. `--yes` skips prompts but does not
  bypass the passthrough gate.
- `.env.bak.*` backups created by `--enable-nvidia-overlay` are ignored by
  Git and the Docker build context.

To enable manually without the script, add this to `.env`:

```bash
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker/gpu.nvidia.yml
```

**AMD / ROCm.** AMD setup is read-only diagnostic plus manual `.env` edit. Run:

```bash
scripts/check-docker-amd-gpu.sh
```

Then add the reported values to `.env`, replacing `RENDER_GID` with your host's
numeric render group id:

```bash
COMPOSE_FILE=docker-compose.yml:docker/gpu.amd.yml
RENDER_GID=989
```

For NVIDIA/AMD GPU support, also read the comments in the selected overlay file: docker/gpu.nvidia.yml or docker/gpu.amd.yml.

**Stack-management UIs (Portainer, Coolify, Dockhand, etc.).** These tools
often accept only a single Compose file and do not reliably honor `COMPOSE_FILE`
or multiple `-f` overlays. CLI users should keep using the `COMPOSE_FILE`
overlay workflow above. For stack UIs, point the stack at one of the standalone
files instead, which bundle the base stack plus the GPU settings:

- `docker-compose.gpu-nvidia.yml` — still requires the NVIDIA Container Toolkit
  on the host.
- `docker-compose.gpu-amd.yml` — still requires host ROCm/kfd/DRI setup, the
  `video`/`render` group membership, and `RENDER_GID` when needed.

The base `docker-compose.yml` plus the `docker/gpu.*.yml` overlays remain the
source of truth; the standalone files mirror them for single-file deployments.

Verify after enabling either overlay:

```bash
docker compose exec pandamonium nvidia-smi -L   # NVIDIA
docker compose exec pandamonium sh -lc 'test -e /dev/kfd && test -d /dev/dri && ls -l /dev/kfd /dev/dri/renderD*'  # AMD
```

> **GPU passthrough ≠ llama.cpp CUDA.** `nvidia-smi` passing inside the
> container confirms Docker GPU access, but llama.cpp also needs `cudart` and
> the CUDA Toolkit at runtime. If Cookbook logs show `Unable to find cudart
> library`, `Could NOT find CUDAToolkit`, `CUDA Toolkit not found`, or
> tensors/layers assigned to CPU, that is a Cookbook/llama.cpp build issue —
> not a Docker passthrough failure. Reinstall the serve engine via
> **Cookbook → Dependencies** to get a CUDA-enabled build.
>
> The same split applies to AMD/ROCm: seeing `/dev/kfd` and `/dev/dri` inside
> the container confirms device passthrough, not ROCm userspace or a
> ROCm-enabled vLLM/llama.cpp build. `rocm-smi` and `rocminfo` are not expected
> inside the slim Pandamonium image.

**Ollama with Docker.** If Ollama runs on the host, add this endpoint in
Settings:

```text
http://host.docker.internal:11434/v1
```

Ollama must listen outside its own loopback interface:

```bash
OLLAMA_HOST=0.0.0.0:11434 ollama serve
```

This connects Pandamonium in Docker to an Ollama server that is already running on
your host machine; it does not start Ollama inside the container.
`host.docker.internal` is Docker's hostname for the host machine from inside the
container. Cookbook **Serve** is a separate workflow for serving downloaded
models through Pandamonium/llama.cpp, so Windows users with an existing Ollama
install usually only need to add the endpoint in Settings.

**Useful checks.**

```bash
docker compose ps
docker compose logs --tail=120 pandamonium
docker compose logs pandamonium | grep -E 'ChromaDB|MemoryVectorStore|DEGRADED'
```

**macOS details.** `start-macos.sh` installs Homebrew deps, creates the venv,
runs setup, and starts uvicorn on port `7860` because AirPlay often holds
`7000`. It uses llama.cpp/Ollama for Metal. vLLM/SGLang are CUDA/ROCm-only and
do not run on macOS. MLX-only models are not served by Pandamonium.

</details>

### Native Windows

**One-command launcher** (creates the venv, installs deps, runs setup, starts the
server; safe to re-run):

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium.git
cd Pandamonium
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\launch-windows.ps1
```

Or do it by hand:

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium.git
cd Pandamonium
py -3.11 -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
python setup.py
python -m uvicorn app:app --host 127.0.0.1 --port 7000
```

If `python` points at an older interpreter, use `py -3.12` (or another installed
3.11+ version) for the venv step.

**Exposing on a LAN/Tailscale (Windows):** the launcher binds to `127.0.0.1` and
does **not** read `APP_BIND` / `PANDAMONIUM_HOST` from `.env`, so editing `.env`
alone leaves the native Windows server on loopback. Pass the launcher's
`-BindHost` flag instead:

```powershell
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\launch-windows.ps1 -BindHost 0.0.0.0
```

The manual `uvicorn` command takes the same address as `--host 0.0.0.0`. Bind
outside loopback only for a trusted LAN/VPN such as Tailscale: keep
`AUTH_ENABLED=true` and do not expose the port directly to the public internet.

**Requirements:** Python 3.11+. The core app (chat, agent, memory, documents,
email, calendar, deep research) runs fully native. For full **Cookbook** background
model downloads and the agent shell tool, also install
[Git for Windows](https://git-scm.com/download/win) (provides `bash.exe`).
Local GPU *serving* of vLLM/SGLang needs Linux/WSL2; for a local model on Windows,
[Ollama](https://ollama.com/download) is the easiest path — point Pandamonium at
`http://localhost:11434/v1` in Settings.

Open `http://localhost:7000`, log in with the generated admin password,
and configure everything else inside **Settings**.

## Troubleshooting & Advanced Setup

### `chromadb-client` conflicts with embedded ChromaDB
If `chromadb-client` (the lightweight HTTP-only package) is installed alongside the full `chromadb` package, Pandamonium starts but ChromaDB silently falls back to HTTP-only mode and fails.

**Fix:** uninstall `chromadb-client` and force-reinstall the full package:
```bash
./venv/bin/pip uninstall chromadb-client -y
./venv/bin/pip install --force-reinstall chromadb
```

### HTTPS + LAN/Tailscale exposure
To expose Pandamonium on a local network or Tailscale with HTTPS:
1. Change the bind address to `0.0.0.0` in `.env` (`APP_BIND=0.0.0.0` or `PANDAMONIUM_HOST=0.0.0.0`).
2. Generate a locally-trusted cert for your LAN/Tailscale IPs using [mkcert](https://github.com/FiloSottile/mkcert):
   ```bash
   mkcert -install
   mkcert -cert-file cert.pem -key-file key.pem <private-lan-ip> tailscale-ip
   ```
3. Run `uvicorn` with the generated certs:
   ```bash
   python -m uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 7000 --ssl-certfile=cert.pem --ssl-keyfile=key.pem
   ```
4. Install the `mkcert` CA on any other device you want to access Pandamonium from (e.g., for iOS, email the `rootCA.pem` to yourself, install the profile, and trust it in Certificate Trust Settings).

### Common self-host traps (30-second fixes)
A grab-bag of small gotchas that otherwise turn into long debugging sessions.

- **`AUTH_ENABLED=false` is ignored / you're still forced to log in (Windows).** If you edited `.env` in Notepad it may have saved a UTF-8 **BOM**, turning the first key into `﻿AUTH_ENABLED` so it is never matched. Pandamonium loads `.env` with `encoding="utf-8-sig"` to tolerate a leading BOM, but the safe fix is to re-save `.env` as **UTF-8 without BOM** (VS Code: *Save with Encoding → UTF-8*).
- **macOS: the app isn't at `http://localhost:7000`.** macOS AirPlay Receiver usually holds port `7000`, so the macOS start script serves on **`7860`** instead — open `http://localhost:7860`. To use `7000`, free it (System Settings → General → AirDrop & Handoff → turn off *AirPlay Receiver*) and set `APP_PORT=7000`.
- **Copy buttons do nothing over a plain-HTTP Tailscale/LAN URL.** Browsers only expose the clipboard API (`navigator.clipboard`) on **secure origins** — HTTPS, or `localhost`. Over `http://100.x.y.z:7860` it is blocked. Serve over HTTPS (see *HTTPS + LAN/Tailscale exposure* above); `localhost` is exempt, so copy still works on the host itself.
- **Self-hosted ntfy reminders don't reach your phone.** Two things: (1) the bundled ntfy binds to loopback by default — to reach it from your phone set `NTFY_BIND` to your host/Tailscale IP and `NTFY_BASE_URL` to the same server URL in `.env`, then recreate the ntfy container (see the `NTFY_*` block in `.env.example`); (2) in the ntfy **Android** app, subscribe to the topic with **Instant delivery** enabled — non-`ntfy.sh` servers don't get instant push otherwise.
- **Local mail (Dovecot) login fails: "Plaintext authentication disallowed on non-encrypted connections."** Your IMAP/SMTP server is refusing cleartext auth over an unencrypted link. Prefer enabling TLS on the mail server; on a trusted LAN only, you can allow cleartext (Dovecot: `disable_plaintext_auth = no`).
- **Calendar/contacts (Radicale) won't sync.** Point Pandamonium at the **full collection URL** with its trailing slash — e.g. `http://host:5232/<user>/<collection-id>/` — not just the server root. Radicale shows this address for each calendar/address book in its web UI.

### Optional Dependencies
`requirements-optional.txt` contains packages that unlock extra features. It is not installed by default.

| Package | Feature unlocked |
|---------|-----------------|
| `faster-whisper` | Local speech-to-text (microphone -> text) via the "local" STT provider. |
| `ddgs` | DuckDuckGo as a search provider option. |
| `PyMuPDF` | PDF page rendering in the side viewer panel and form-filling. (Note: AGPL-3.0) |
| `markitdown` | Office/EPUB document text extraction (converts .docx/.xlsx/.pptx/.xls/.epub to Markdown). |

### Faster, reproducible installs with uv (optional)
[uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) works as a drop-in replacement for the
venv + pip steps in the native install guides, no project changes are needed but this change results in faster installs along with a lockfile for reproducible environments. After [installing `uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/), use:

```bash
uv venv venv --python 3.13
uv pip install -r requirements.txt
# then continue as usual: python setup.py, uvicorn, ...
```

`requirements.txt` is intentionally unpinned, so two installs at different times can produce different package versions. If you want a reproducible environment (e.g. across your own machines, or to roll back after a bad upgrade), snapshot and restore exact versions with:

```bash
uv pip compile requirements.txt -o requirements.lock   # snapshot current resolution
uv pip sync requirements.lock                          # reproduce it exactly later
```

`requirements.lock` is gitignored and platform-specific (compile it on the OS you deploy to). Regenerate it deliberately when you want to take upgrades. The plain `uv pip install -r requirements.txt` keeps following the unpinned requirements like pip does.

### Outlook / Office 365 email
Pandamonium email accounts currently use IMAP/SMTP username-password auth. Outlook
and Microsoft 365 generally require OAuth instead, so normal Microsoft mailbox
passwords will fail. See [docs/email-outlook.md](docs/email-outlook.md) for the
current limitation and the planned integration direction.

## Security Notes
Pandamonium is a self-hosted workspace with powerful local tools: shell access, file uploads, model downloads, web research, email/calendar integrations, and API tokens. Treat it like an admin console.

- Keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true` for any network-accessible deployment.
- Keep `LOCALHOST_BYPASS=false` outside local development.
- Use `SECURE_COOKIES=true` when Pandamonium is served through HTTPS by a trusted reverse proxy or private access gateway.
- Do not expose it directly to the public internet without HTTPS and a trusted reverse proxy or private access layer.
- Keep `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, databases, uploads, generated media, backups, auth/session files, API keys, and model/provider tokens out of Git and private shares. They are ignored by default.
- Review `data/auth.json` after first boot: disable open signup unless you intentionally want it, make only your own account admin, and keep demo/test accounts non-admin.
- Non-admin users do not get shell/Python/file read/write by default, and admin-only routes/tools such as MCP management, API tokens, webhooks, model/cookbook serving, backup/vault, and app settings are admin-gated. Other features are controlled by per-user privileges, so review each user's privileges before exposing a deployment.
- Rotate any API keys or tokens that were ever pasted into a shared chat, demo, screenshot, or log.
- If you enable API tokens or webhooks, create separate tokens per integration and delete unused ones.
- Prefer binding manual development runs to `127.0.0.1`; bind to `0.0.0.0` only when you intentionally want LAN/reverse-proxy access.
- Keep ChromaDB, SearXNG, ntfy, Ollama, vLLM, llama.cpp, databases, and raw model/provider APIs internal-only. Expose only the authenticated Pandamonium web/API entrypoint through your trusted proxy or private access layer.
- Before publishing a fork, run `git status --short` and confirm no private files from `.env`, `data/`, `logs/`, uploads, backups, or local databases are staged.

### Private or proxied deployments
Pandamonium serves plain HTTP on its app port. Docker Compose binds Pandamonium and the bundled services to `127.0.0.1` by default, so a typical production/private setup is:

1. Keep Pandamonium on localhost, for example `127.0.0.1:7000`.
2. Terminate HTTPS at a trusted reverse proxy or private access gateway.
3. Put the authenticated Pandamonium web/API entrypoint behind that layer.
4. Keep raw service and model ports internal-only.

Cloudflare Access, Tailscale, Caddy, nginx, and Traefik can all fit this pattern; none are required by Pandamonium. If your access layer reaches Pandamonium on the same host, proxy to `http://127.0.0.1:7000` and keep `AUTH_ENABLED=true`, `LOCALHOST_BYPASS=false`, and `SECURE_COOKIES=true`.
`ALLOWED_ORIGINS` lists exact permitted origins for cross-origin browser/API clients; ordinary same-origin reverse-proxy access usually does not need a special CORS entry.

Common internal-only ports from the default docs/compose setup:

| Port | Service |
|---|---|
| `7000` | Pandamonium raw app port |
| `8080` | SearXNG |
| `8091` | ntfy |
| `8100` | ChromaDB host port for manual/compose access |
| `11434` | Ollama |
| `8000-8020` | Common local model/provider APIs |

## Configuration
Most setup is done inside the app with `/setup` or **Settings**. Use `.env`
for deployment-level defaults and secrets you want present before first boot.
Key settings:

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `LLM_HOST` | `localhost` | Your LLM server (e.g. `llm-host.local:8000`) |
| `LLM_HOSTS` | -- | Comma-separated list for model discovery |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | -- | Optional OpenAI key. Prefer adding providers in the app unless pre-seeding. |
| `SEARXNG_INSTANCE` | `http://localhost:8080` | SearXNG URL. Docker overrides this to `http://searxng:8080`. |
| `SEARXNG_SECRET` | generated on first Docker boot | Optional SearXNG cookie/CSRF secret. Leave blank unless you need to pin it. |
| `APP_BIND` | `127.0.0.1` | Docker Compose host bind address for the web UI. Use `0.0.0.0` only for intentional LAN/reverse-proxy access. |
| `APP_PORT` | `7000` | Docker Compose host port for the web UI. |
| `APP_DATA_DIR` | `./data` | Docker Compose host directory for application data volumes. |
| `APP_LOGS_DIR` | `./logs` | Docker Compose host directory for application logs. |
| `AUTH_ENABLED` | `true` | Enable/disable login |
| `LOCALHOST_BYPASS` | `false` | Development-only auth bypass for loopback requests. Keep false for shared/network deployments. |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | `http://localhost,http://127.0.0.1` | Comma-separated exact permitted origins for cross-origin browser/API clients. |
| `SECURE_COOKIES` | `false` | Set true when serving Pandamonium through HTTPS at a trusted proxy or private access gateway. |
| `DATABASE_URL` | `sqlite:///./data/app.db` | Database connection string |
| `CHROMADB_HOST` | `localhost` | ChromaDB host for vector memory. Docker overrides this to `chromadb`. |
| `CHROMADB_PORT` | `8100` | ChromaDB port for manual host runs. Docker overrides this to `8000`. |
| `EMBEDDING_URL` | -- | OpenAI-compatible embeddings endpoint |
| `QDRANT_URL` | -- | Optional Qdrant projection endpoint; unset keeps the projection disabled |
| `QDRANT_API_KEY` | -- | Optional Qdrant API key |
| `PANDAMONIUM_QDRANT_MEMORY_COLLECTION` | `odysseus_memory` | Approved personal-memory projection; legacy `JARVIS_` name remains accepted |
| `PANDAMONIUM_QDRANT_DOCUMENT_COLLECTION` | `odysseus_documents` | Canonical-document projection; legacy `JARVIS_` name remains accepted |
| `PANDAMONIUM_QDRANT_WIKI_COLLECTION` | `odysseus_wiki` | Generated-wiki projection; legacy `JARVIS_` name remains accepted |
| `PANDAMONIUM_QDRANT_READS_ENABLED` | `false` | Promote Qdrant reads only after live parity checks; legacy `JARVIS_` name remains accepted |
| `PANDAMONIUM_GRAPHIFY_ROOTS` | -- | Optional JSON map of explicit repository/output roots; no startup or workspace scan occurs |
| `PANDAMONIUM_CHAT_UPLOAD_MAX_BYTES` | `10485760` | Chat/agent attachment cap in bytes. Raise for larger local PDFs or text documents. |

All upload-limit vars are validated (must be a positive integer) and optional; an invalid value fails fast at startup.

### Built-in MCP servers (optional setup)

Pandamonium auto-registers a few built-in MCP servers at startup. The npx-based ones (currently the browser server, `@playwright/mcp`) only start when their npm package is already in the local npx cache. If a package isn't cached, that server is skipped with a startup log message explaining what to do, so a fresh install does not block on a multi-minute npm download or hang if Playwright system deps are missing.

To enable the browser MCP (page navigation, screenshots, vision), run once:

```bash
npx -y @playwright/mcp@latest --version
```

That installs `@playwright/mcp` plus Playwright (~300MB total). Restart Pandamonium and the server will register at startup.

## Architecture
```
app.py                   # FastAPI entry point
core/      auth, database, middleware, constants
src/       llm_core, agent_loop, agent_tools, chat_processor, search/
routes/    chat, session, document, memory, model … endpoints
services/  docs, memory, search, hwfit (Cookbook) …
static/    index.html + app.js + style.css + js/ (modular front-end)
docs/      landing page (index.html) + preview clips
```

## Data
All user data lives in `data/` (gitignored): `app.db` (sessions, messages, documents),
`memory.json`, `presets.json`, `uploads/`, `personal_docs/`, `chroma/`, `settings.json`.

To back up or restore everything in `data/`, see the
[Backup & Restore guide](backup-restore.md).
