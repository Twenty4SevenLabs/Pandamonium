# Marketplace publishing runbook

How to build, sign, publish, and revoke the Pandamonium extension catalog
(MAD-941). The runtime side of the contract is implemented in
`src/marketplace_catalog.py`; the catalog format is defined in
`specs/pandamonium-extension-catalog-contract.md` and
`specs/schemas/pandamonium-extension-catalog-v1.schema.json`.

## 1. Signing key custody

The catalog and every package artifact are signed with one Ed25519 key. Keep
the private key **outside Git**, readable only by the publisher:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.config/pandamonium
openssl genpkey -algorithm ED25519 -out ~/.config/pandamonium/marketplace-signing.pem
chmod 600 ~/.config/pandamonium/marketplace-signing.pem
```

The key id (for example `pandamonium-marketplace-2026`) is embedded in the
catalog and in `trusted_keys.json`. Only the public key half is deployed to
installations. Generate `trusted_keys.json` with the build (step 3); never
commit the private key.

## 2. Package list

Each entry in `marketplace/packages.json` pins a public repository and an
immutable tag:

```json
{
  "extension_id": "oracle",
  "source_url": "https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/ORACLE.git",
  "ref": "jos-v0.1.0",
  "summary": "...",
  "categories": ["visualization"],
  "license": "MIT",
  "publisher": {"id": "madpanda3d", "name": "MADPANDA3D", "url": "https://github.com/MADPANDA3D"},
  "compatibility": {
    "pandamonium_min": "1.0.10",
    "pandamonium_max": "1.99.99",
    "platforms": ["linux", "macos"],
    "architectures": ["amd64", "arm64"]
  },
  "restart_required": "none"
}
```

The repository must contain a strict `jarvis-extension.json`; the build
rewrites its `source.revision` to the resolved commit so the catalog entry is
pinned. Configuration declarations from the manifest are mirrored into the
catalog entry (names/flags only, never values).

## 3. Build

```bash
python scripts/build_marketplace_catalog.py \
  --packages marketplace/packages.json \
  --private-key ~/.config/pandamonium/marketplace-signing.pem \
  --key-id pandamonium-marketplace-2026 \
  --artifact-base-url https://github.com/MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium/releases/download/marketplace-v1 \
  --catalog-id pandamonium-community \
  --out dist-marketplace
```

Output: `catalog.json`, `trusted_keys.json`, and one
`pandamonium-plugin-<id>-<version>.tar.gz` per package. The build is static:
it clones the pinned ref, validates the manifest, archives the exact tree
(`git archive`), hashes it, and Ed25519-signs both the artifact digest
(`sha256:<digest>`) and the catalog (canonical JSON without the signature).
No package code is executed.

## 4. Publish artifacts and catalog

Upload the catalog, trusted keys, and package archives together under the
same release tag the build used as `--artifact-base-url`:

```bash
gh release create marketplace-v1 --repo MADPANDA3D/Pandamonium \
  --title "Marketplace catalog v1" \
  --notes "Signed Pandamonium extension catalog (pandamonium-community)." \
  dist-marketplace/catalog.json dist-marketplace/trusted_keys.json dist-marketplace/*.tar.gz
```

The catalog's artifact URLs must match the release asset URLs exactly
(`https://github.com/<owner>/<repo>/releases/download/marketplace-v1/<file>`).

## 5. Deploy to an installation

The marketplace loader reads two files on the host (default
`$PANDAMONIUM_DATA_DIR/marketplace/`):

```bash
install -d -o odysseus -g odysseus /srv/odysseus/data/marketplace
install -o odysseus -g odysseus -m 0644 dist-marketplace/catalog.json /srv/odysseus/data/marketplace/catalog.json
install -o odysseus -g odysseus -m 0644 dist-marketplace/trusted_keys.json /srv/odysseus/data/marketplace/trusted_keys.json
```

No service restart is required: the loader reads the files per request. Verify
the live view reports the catalog as ready and lists the published packages
(Add Plugins → Available), then install one package through the normal
approval flow.

## 6. Revoke, deprecate, and roll back

- **Revoke one package:** rebuild the catalog with that entry removed (or
  `review.status` set to `revoked` in a follow-up entry), re-upload the
  catalog, and redeploy `catalog.json`. Installed copies are unaffected;
  updates and installs fail closed.
- **Revoke a key:** remove the key id from `trusted_keys.json` and redeploy;
  every catalog/artifact signed by it fails verification.
- **Roll back:** keep the previous `catalog.json` and reinstall it; catalog
  files are small and versioned by release tag.
- **Expiry:** catalogs carry `expires_at` (default 90 days). Build a fresh
  catalog before expiry; expired catalogs fail closed with
  `marketplace_catalog_expired`.
